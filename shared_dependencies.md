Shared Dependencies:

1. Django Framework: All the Python files in the project will be using Django's modules and methods for building the web application.

2. PostgreSQL Database: The models.py file will define the data schema for the PostgreSQL database. The views.py file will interact with this database to perform CRUD operations.

3. URL Patterns: The urls.py files in the project root and the plugin_scanner app will share URL patterns. These patterns will be used to route the user to the correct view based on their request.

4. HTML Templates: The views.py file will render the HTML templates defined in the templates/plugin_scanner directory. These templates will share common elements such as the base layout, CSS, and JavaScript files.

5. CSS and JavaScript Files: The HTML templates will use the styles.css and main.js files located in the static directory. These files will be used to style the web pages and add interactivity.

6. Plugin Model: The views.py, admin.py, and tests.py files will all interact with the Plugin model defined in models.py. This model will represent the audio plugins in the database.

7. Requirements.txt: This file will list all the Python packages required for the project. All Python files in the project will share these dependencies.

8. README.md and INSTRUCTIONS.md: These files will provide information about the project and how to use it. They will be accessible from the project root.

9. Function Names: Functions such as scan_plugins(), get_plugin_data(), check_version() etc. will be used across multiple files like views.py and main.js.

10. DOM Element IDs: IDs such as "plugin-table", "search-button", "version-check" etc. will be used in the HTML templates and the main.js file for manipulating the DOM.

11. Message Names: Messages like "scan_complete", "plugin_found", "version_checked" etc. will be used in the views.py and main.js files for user notifications.
